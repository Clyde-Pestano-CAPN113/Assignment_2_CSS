Design Choices: 
i wanted my website to be sorta like indeed wher you could find a job listing for construction jobs. i did it in basic white for the backgorund and black for the text. for the nav bar i wanted there to be a way to open a sidebar for more information about internships and stuff like that and the sidebar should have a close bar that is the red box at the top.
